# Shared Context -- career-ops

<!-- ============================================================
     HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THIS FILE
     ============================================================
     This file contains the shared context for all career-ops modes.
     Before using career-ops, you MUST:
     1. Fill in config/profile.yml with your personal data
     2. Create your cv.md in the project root
     3. (Optional) Create article-digest.md with your proof points
     4. Customize the sections below marked with [CUSTOMIZE]
     ============================================================ -->

## Sources of Truth (ALWAYS read before evaluating)

| File | Path | When |
|------|------|------|
| cv.md | `cv.md` (project root) | ALWAYS |
| article-digest.md | `article-digest.md` (if exists) | ALWAYS (detailed proof points) |
| profile.yml | `config/profile.yml` | ALWAYS (candidate identity and targets) |

**RULE: NEVER hardcode metrics from proof points.** Read them from cv.md + article-digest.md at evaluation time.
**RULE: For article/project metrics, article-digest.md takes precedence over cv.md** (cv.md may have older numbers).

## North Star -- Target Roles

The skill applies with EQUAL rigor to ALL target roles. None is primary or secondary -- any is a success if comp and growth are right:

| Archetype | Thematic axes | What they buy |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Technical Support Manager** | Team leadership, CSAT, SLA ownership, TSE coaching | Someone who runs a high-performing support team with data and discipline |
| **Support Engineering Manager** | API/integration support, escalation management, technical depth | Someone who bridges support and engineering with technical credibility |
| **Support Operations Manager** | Tooling, workflows, automation, forecasting, metrics | Someone who scales support ops through systems and AI-powered tooling |
| **Technical Support Director** | Org design, cross-functional strategy, multi-region leadership | Someone who leads support at the organizational level with exec presence |
| **Support Engineering Director** | Engineering partnerships, escalation strategy, platform support | Someone who owns the technical support function at scale |

### Adaptive Framing by Archetype

> **Concrete metrics: read from `cv.md` + `article-digest.md` at evaluation time. NEVER hardcode numbers here.**

| If the role is... | Emphasize about the candidate... | Proof point sources |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Technical Support Manager | Team leadership, player-coach style, CSAT ownership, hybrid team management | cv.md (Sigma, Benchmark) |
| Support Engineering Manager | Technical depth (APIs, integrations, SQL), escalation ownership, eng partnership | cv.md (Sigma, Lytx) |
| Support Operations Manager | Tooling automation, forecasting, Power BI/Python, workflow design, Jedana | cv.md + Jedana project |
| Technical Support Director | Org design, multi-team leadership, cross-functional strategy, exec communication | cv.md (Benchmark 20-person team) |
| Support Engineering Director | Platform support at scale, incident command, SEV-0/1 leadership, technical credibility | cv.md (Sigma, Lytx) |

### Exit Narrative (use in ALL framings)

Use the candidate's exit story from `config/profile.yml` to frame ALL content:
- **In PDF Summaries:** Bridge from past to future -- "Now applying the same [skill] to [JD domain]."
- **In STAR stories:** Reference proof points from cv.md (Sigma, Benchmark, Jedana)
- **In Draft Answers (Section G):** The leadership + builder angle should appear in the first response.
- **When the JD asks for "player-coach", "data-driven", "scalable", "cross-functional":** This is the #1 differentiator. Increase match weight.

### Cross-cutting Advantage

Frame profile as **"Support leader who builds the systems, not just manages them"** that adapts framing to the role:
- For Support Manager: "leader who raises CSAT and team performance through coaching and tooling"
- For Support Ops: "operator who automates workflows and builds forecasting models others rely on"
- For Support Engineering Manager: "technical lead who owns complex escalations and partners with eng credibly"
- For Director: "org builder who scales support with AI tooling, data, and cross-functional influence"

The Jedana project (AI-powered support analytics, built independently) is a strong differentiator — it shows Stephen doesn't just manage support, he builds tools for it.

### Portfolio as Proof Point (use in high-value applications)

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] If you have a live demo, dashboard, or public project, configure it here.
     Example:
     dashboard:
       url: "https://yoursite.dev/demo"
       password: "demo-2026"
       when_to_share: "LLMOps, AI Platform, observability roles"
     Read from config/profile.yml → narrative.proof_points and narrative.dashboard -->

If the candidate has a live demo/dashboard (check profile.yml), offer access in applications for relevant roles.

### Comp Intelligence

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Research comp ranges for YOUR target roles and update these ranges -->

**General guidance:**
- Use WebSearch for current market data (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Blind)
- Frame by role title, not by skills -- titles determine comp bands
- Contractor rates are typically 30-50% higher than employee base to account for benefits
- Geographic arbitrage works for remote roles: lower CoL = better net

### Negotiation Scripts

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Adapt these to your situation -->

**Salary expectations (general framework):**
> "Based on market data for this role, I'm targeting [RANGE from profile.yml]. I'm flexible on structure -- what matters is the total package and the opportunity."

**Geographic discount pushback:**
> "The roles I'm competitive for are output-based, not location-based. My track record doesn't change based on postal code."

**When offered below target:**
> "I'm comparing with opportunities in the [higher range]. I'm drawn to [company] because of [reason]. Can we explore [target]?"

### Location Policy

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Adapt to your situation. Read from config/profile.yml → location -->

**In forms:**
- Binary "can you be on-site?" questions: follow your actual availability from profile.yml
- In free-text fields: specify your timezone overlap and availability

**In evaluations (scoring):**
- Remote dimension for hybrid outside your country: score **3.0** (not 1.0)
- Only score 1.0 if JD explicitly says "must be on-site 4-5 days/week, no exceptions"

### Time-to-offer priority
- Working demo + metrics > perfection
- Apply sooner > learn more
- 80/20 approach, timebox everything

## Global Rules

### NEVER

1. Invent experience or metrics
2. Modify cv.md or portfolio files
3. Submit applications on behalf of the candidate
4. Share phone number in generated messages
5. Recommend comp below market rate
6. Generate a PDF without reading the JD first
7. Use corporate-speak
8. Ignore the tracker (every evaluated offer gets registered)

### ALWAYS

0. **Cover letter:** If the form has an option to attach or write a cover letter, ALWAYS include one. Generate PDF with the same visual design as the CV. Content: JD quotes mapped to proof points, links to relevant case studies. 1 page max.
1. Read cv.md and article-digest.md (if exists) before evaluating any offer
1b. **First evaluation of each session:** Run `node cv-sync-check.mjs` with Bash. If it reports warnings, notify the candidate before continuing
2. Detect the role archetype and adapt framing
3. Cite exact lines from CV when matching
4. Use WebSearch for comp and company data
5. Register in tracker after evaluating
6. Generate content in the language of the JD (EN default)
7. Be direct and actionable -- no fluff
8. When generating English text (PDF summaries, bullets, LinkedIn messages, STAR stories): native tech English, not translated. Short sentences, action verbs, no unnecessary passive voice.
8b. **Case study URLs in PDF Professional Summary:** If the PDF mentions case studies or demos, URLs MUST appear in the first paragraph (Professional Summary). The recruiter may only read the summary. All URLs with `white-space: nowrap` in HTML.
9. **Tracker additions as TSV** -- NEVER edit applications.md to add new entries. Write TSV in `batch/tracker-additions/` and `merge-tracker.mjs` handles the merge.
10. **Include `**URL:**` in every report header** -- between Score and PDF.

### Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| WebSearch | Comp research, trends, company culture, LinkedIn contacts, fallback for JDs |
| WebFetch | Fallback for extracting JDs from static pages |
| Playwright | Verify if offers are still active (browser_navigate + browser_snapshot), extract JDs from SPAs. **CRITICAL: NEVER launch 2+ agents with Playwright in parallel -- they share a single browser instance.** |
| Read | cv.md, article-digest.md, cv-template.html |
| Write | Temporary HTML for PDF, applications.md, reports .md |
| Edit | Update tracker |
| Bash | `node generate-pdf.mjs` |
